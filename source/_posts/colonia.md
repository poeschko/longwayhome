Guess what: We're back on the road (or on waterways, depends on where we're headed)! Two great months in BA went by really fast and the remaining two months of our big trip through the Americas will be more adventurous, exciting and fast-paced again, leading us first to Uruguay, back to the North and Northwest of Argentina, to Chile and finally to Patagonia.

Across the Río de la Plata, a one-hour ferry ride away, is Colonia del Sacramento, a charming small city in charming small Uruguay. Originally founded by the Portuguese, it is one of the oldest towns in Uruguay and boasts buildings of Spanish, Portuguese and post-colonial styles and cobblestone streets.

The old town *casco viejo* had the perfect size to stroll around for an afternoon. At the wharf, we chatted with some Swedes who sailed all the way from Sweden to Brazil (stopping in Portugal and Cabo Verde) in only 25 days.

However, the beer van (a remodeled Volkswagen RV with craft beer taps sticking out of the side window) parked at a central place in Colonia's old town was more our kind of vehicle.
