Oh, Granada! We really liked this colorful, buzzing, charming city. Despite being more touristy and international than the other places we've visited so far, Granada still boasts very authentic flair: the busy market and street life, locals hanging out in rocking chairs at the front doors of their houses, and wild traffic.

We also included some work days at the fantastic [Garden Café](http://www.gardencafegranada.com/). Great fresh lemonade for $1 a glass!

Over the past ten days, our daily rhythm had become synchronized with the sun: We got up early (ocassinally with the *cocoricoo* of roosters) and used to call it a night early. However, we couldn't help but enjoy Granada's *Calzada*, a broad pedestrian street lined with bars, restaurants and *hospedajes*, where the Happy Hour seems to start mid-afternoon and goes on and on and on...

## Laguna de Apoyo

We took a day-trip to Laguna de Apoyo, a freshwater lake in the crater of an imploded volcano. We spent the day kayaking, swimming, floating in rubber rings and sunbathing at the [Hostel Paradiso](http://hostelparadiso.com/) at the shore of the Laguna. From the lake, hardly any houses are in sight and there's no real village around the lake, just trees over trees and nature. Along with a cold Toña and a chilled Sangria, this place actually came pretty close to paradise.

A couple of hours later, our shuttle dropped us off at la *Calzada* just in time for Happy Hour.
