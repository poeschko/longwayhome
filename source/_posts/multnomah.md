A short drive from Portland are the gorgeous [Multnomah Falls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multnomah_Falls). Its two steps combined result in a drop of 189 m (620 ft), making it the second tallest year-round waterfall in the United States.

We hiked up to the top of the upper falls. Well, it wasn't really hiking: The path was paved and it didn't even take 30 minutes to get up.

The manual controls on our Panasonic Lumix LX100 came in really handy for taking these soft water pictures.
