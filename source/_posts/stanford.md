Since we passed through the Bay Area again, we had to make a visit to the beautiful [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) campus, where Jan had spent the summer of 2011 working on [some geeky project](http://web.stanford.edu/~natalya/papers/Poschko_AAAI_Symp.pdf).

The best thing was that we met Csongor, Tania, Klara and even Pablo, who happened to be visiting from his new hometown Graz. The [pizza](http://www.napoletanapizzeria.com/) was also fantastic.
