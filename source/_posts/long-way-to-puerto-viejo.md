This time we didn't choose the easy option, which would have been a direct 3-hour boat ride. Instead, we left at 8 in the morning, taking one boat and four different buses (for a third of the price). We arrived at 7 in the evening. A bed and a bathroom hardly ever felt that good before.

[Hotel Novelty Playa](https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Hotel_Review-g309265-d7933131-Reviews-Hotel_Novelty_Playa-Puerto_Viejo_de_Talamanca_Province_of_Limon.html) is a bit out of town, but definitely worth staying there! Host Luis (from Albacete, Spain) is super-nice, the rooms (there are only three!) are gorgeous, and you'll never want to leave that balcony.
