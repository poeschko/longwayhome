Before heading to Seattle, there was one place we *had* to pay a visit to. Hint no. 1: It involves a cherry pie that will kill you and—excuse me—a damn fine cup of coffee. Hint no. 2: It is set in the fictitious city of Twin Peaks.

We had started watching the early 90s cult show "Twin Peaks" because it stars our beloved mayor of Portland in the show "Portlandia" (see our [previous post](/2015/11/03/portlandia/)), Kyle McLachlan, also known as The Captain in "How I Met Your Mother". And because it was conviniently available on Netflix. From episode 1, we were hooked. Just as much as the main character FBI Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle McLachlan) was hooked to the delicious cherry pie at the RR Diner in Twin Peaks (though, admittedly, he had a somewhat serious coffee addiction).

When we found out that the diner that served as the RR Diner in the show really existed (and still does!) and is located in a town called North Bend 30 minutes east of Seattle, we knew we had to go there. In reality, it is called [Twede's Café](http://www.twedescafe.com/) and, damn, its cherrie and boysenberry pies are good! And Agent Cooper didn't lie about the coffee, either.
