Antelope Canyon situated on Navajo land near Page, Arizona is a slot canyon formed by erosion of sandstone. It consists of Upper Antelope Canyon (at ground level) and Lower Antelope Canyon (below ground).

Various private companies offer tours of either of the two canyons. We went with [Ken's Guided Tour](http://lowerantelope.com/) into the Lower, since it's supposedly less crowded due to its more difficult access. (Well, it's just a ladder.) Also, the light beams which the Upper is famous for are gone by mid October anyway.

Photography in Antelope Canyon is difficult due to the wide-ranging light conditions (and overambitious fellow photographers). But we still got some nice shots.

Close to Page is also Horseshoe Bend, a gorgeous meander of the Colorado River, surrounded by 300-meter high rock walls.
