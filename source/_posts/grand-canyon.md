Leaving San Diego and our small bungalow in Pacific Beach, we headed East, towards Arizona and the Grand Canyon. 

*Next exit, Mexico.*

We got pretty close to the Mexican border, without never actually seeing it. But by the nothingness around us and the thousands of stones in a very sparse and inhospitable landscape, you could tell that this was, if not no man's land, then border land. For dozens of miles, we saw no sign of civilization. It also seemed to us as if Arizona was home to more [RV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-G8weg2Ndg)s than humans.

To stretch our legs, we stopped at Scottsdale a few miles north of Phoenix, Arizona.

If we were sure about one thing concerning our trip, it was that we would not have to deal with winter and cold temperature this year. Well... we were wrong. When we woke up in Tusayan, the gateway to the South Rim of Grand Canyon, and looked out of the window, we believed for a brief instant that we were dislocated to Chicago again. Snow? Gray sky? Strong wind? Classic Chicago winter weather. Still, we were able to get a few good views of the Grand Canyon. And we already knew that it wouldn't be the last time to see the Grand Canyon...

We decided to get the $80 [Interagency Annual Pass](http://www.nps.gov/findapark/passes.htm) that gives you access to all national parks for a year (not the calendar year but twelve consecutive months). Since we planned on visiting Bryce Canyon, Death Valley, Zion and Sequoia National Park besides the Grand Canyon, the pass really paid off. The entrance fee for a passenger car to the National Parks typically ranges between $20 and $30. You can also get an individual park pass first and upgrade to the annual pass within one week, only paying the difference (at any park entrance).

Dinner was a Navajo Taco, which is hot beef, cheese and vegetables on a "frybread" (similar to Hungary's lángos).
