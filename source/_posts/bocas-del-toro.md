> Oh, how beautiful Panama is!

And it was beautiful, indeed. We were lucky at the border (only a few minutes wait time—others said waited for hours) and the whole trip to the little island paradise of Bocas del Toro went very smoothly. Only note to ourselves: If the sea is rough, don't take the outer seats of the last row in the boat (or enjoy getting soaked).

We didn't know that Bocas has its own microclimate. We had almost exclusively had nice weather so far, but apparently, Bocas was right in the middle of its rainy season. That was a good excuse to get some work done, and we also had great fun playing Monolopy with Gül and Sinan, a really nice German couple. When the sun came out for a few hours, we set off together on a boat trip to Red Frog Beach.

Both [Bubba's House](https://www.facebook.com/bubbas.house.bastimentos/) and the [Bambuda Lodge](http://bambuda.net/) had a really nice, laid-back vibe. Just the right preparation for our Christmas adventure...
