All we knew so far about Portland, Oregon, we knew from the satirical TV show [Portlandia](http://www.ifc.com/shows/portlandia). According to the show, Portland is every hipster's dream, a place where you can ask for the last name of the chicken you're about to order in an all-organic restaurant (probably with a side of massaged kale, fair-trade quinoa or turnip from a local farm), a heaven for pedestrians and cyclists.

It wasn't that bad, though. Quite on the contrary, we experienced Portland as a refreshingly relaxed, unpretentious yet quirky, creative, environmentally conscious city. Where else do you find a mayor who had his private parking space in front of the city hall transformed into a garden and now takes public transport like everyone else?

## Microbreweries, Voodoo Doughnuts and Food Carts

Portland was indeed a great city to begin our 5-month-adventure on the road. Especially because the roads we encountered there were pedestrian-, bike- and skateboard-friendly (skateboards used to have their designated lanes on the streets!), covered in red bricks.

Portland was also a great starting point not just because of the city's 50+ microbreweries that take advantage of the great water and the excellent hops production, but also because one of Portland's top attractions is, in fact, a donut store. [Voodoo Doughnuts](http://voodoodoughnut.com/doughnuts.php) has donut variations that blow up your imagination: donuts with fruit loops, cookie dough balls, oreos or strips of bacon on top; an "Oh Captain! My Captain!" donut, an Old Dirty Bastard donut, the options are endless... Our clear favorite was the Portland Cream one, basically a regular donut filled with vanilla cream and chocolate glaze on top.

Of course, we didn't miss out on the microbreweries either: We enjoyed a beer flight at [Deschutes Brewery](http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/beer/ "Deschutes Brewery").

{% wide_image /2015/11/03/portlandia/Portlandia-2.jpg "All parts of Portland are dotted with food carts, typically tiny trailers with one or two windows and a fully equipped kitchen inside, where tacos, thai food, gyros, ramen bowls, waffles and other delights are prepared." %}

Now you think all we did was eating and drinking. You're right. But in addition to that, we also spent hours and hours walking (for example during Portland's award-winning Walking Tour) and strolling through the City of Books, a gigantic bookstore that takes up a whole block. We've never seen so many people in a bookstore, let alone such a large bookstore. It has a color-guidance system, just as in hospitals, so you don't get lost and kind of keep a sense of where you are. This helped a lot when we tried to find our way out after buying Jan a Spanish Grammar and a Latinamerican Spanish Vocabulary book. ¡Dios mío!

We stayed at the [Evermore Guesthouse](http://www.evermoreguesthouse.com/), an incredibly beautiful historic building from 1909, where we had breakfast every morning at the community table in the living room of the house, together with other guests who stayed there.
