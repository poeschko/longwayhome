Costa Rica's capital feels like a mixture of a medium-sized US-American and a large Spanish city. Outlets, US chains, better, bigger and more expensive cars all contrasted sharply with what we were used to see in Nicaragua.

Not too thrilled about the city, we spent most of our time getting some work done in the comfortable patio of [Casa 69](http://www.casa69.com/).
