Small talk in the supermarket's checkout queue. Simone is approached by a local and asked where she is from: "In Austria, people know about Uruguay?" – "Yes, they do." – "*Why*?"

We were certainly happy to be among the few tourists who did visit. Montevideo is a laid-back, friendly, modern Latin American city, though without too much accent on *Latino*, to be honest.

In the charming little old town, the Mercado del Puerto is a mecca for meat lovers, with one barbecue stand next to another. There we had our first encounter with the delicious *medio y medio*, a mix of sparkling wine and sweet white wine. The perfect Tuesday afternoon drink!

And, of course, the beach with its beachfront walk, the *Ramblas*, was something we enjoyed very much after having been "city-borne" for quite some time. (Although BA and Montevideo both lie on the Río de la Plata, the brownish water on BA's side doesn't really invite to take a swim.)

We were desperately looking for [Jeff the Diseased Lung](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UsHHOCH4q8), but eventually learned that his billboard was removed a while ago. Nonetheless: #JeffWeCan!

Jan found the perfect substitute for his beloved Kebab (which had been hard to come by in Chicago anyway) and Italian Beef (very hard to ignore in Chicago): *Chivito*! That's a typical Uruguayan (*cough* fast food *cough*) dish that you can have either as a sandwich (*en pan batta* or *tortuga*) or on a plate (*al plato*, on a load of fries). It's made of thin slices of beef, a fried egg, lettuce, pickles, cheese, mayonnaise and other optional ingredients. Jan had chivitos from the chivito place in our street three days in a row. One time, he even (successfully) bribed the staff to postpone their lunch break (well, the indispensable four-hour siesta). That's how good it was. Especially when enjoyed at the nearby beach.
