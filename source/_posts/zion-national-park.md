Our exploration of America's canyons continued. This time, we visited Zion National Park in Utah. None of the canyons we visited so far had been like the other. From Grand Canyon's giant steep cliffs cut by the force of water over thousands of years, over a colorful feast for the eyes at the bottom of Antelope canyon, to the countless pin-like stone formations of Bryce Canyonâ€”every national park was a highlight by itself. Zion Canyon was probably less impressive by the curious shapes of its geological formation than by the sheer majesty of its rocks.

Undisputedly, Zion Canyon's most famous hike is [Angel's Landing](http://utah.com/hiking/zion-national-park/angels-landing?cx_grid_position=1&cx_grid_size=2x2&cx_grid_image=full-image&cx_link_type=grid-link&cx_page_id=555cbc7be92e3c7e1d78c192&cx_source_page_id=558b1839e92e3caa4c60709d), advertised by that very website as "Not for the faint hearted. More for the die harded." It's an occasionally very steep path with sheer drop-offs on both sides, taking hikers along the rock's narrow ridge. Angel's Landing was definitely very tempting... However, due to lack of time (and Simone being concerned that we weren't "mentally prepared" enough for the thrill), we did the Emerald Pools trail instead, which was mentally rather comforting with its waterfalls and small pools of green and blue water.

While Simone continued to hike a bit, the mental challenge for Jan was finding a spot with cell phone reception to join his scheduled phone meeting in the middle of the national park.
