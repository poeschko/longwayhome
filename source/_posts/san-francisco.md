After more than 3 weeks of traveling, we have to admit that we began to feel a bit tired and washed out. So on Thanksgiving Day, we took a day off from our vacation and did as the Americans: relaxing, hanging out on the sofa and in the bed, cooking (OK, we skipped the Turkey and Pie  but had delicious home-made Spaghetti Bolognese paired with a bottle of Sangiovese from the recently visited [Castello di Amorosa](http://www.castellodiamorosa.com/)). Oh, and we caught up on blogging and making the last preparations for our upcoming Central America trip.

On Friday, we went to explore the city. We walked Fisherman's Wharf and the steep hills of San Francisco, through Chinatown and the (not-so-exciting) Financial District.

Public transportation in the Bay Area is generally pretty good, but very fragmented: Separate tickets are required for buses, [BART](http://www.bart.gov/), cable cars (the long wait time made us not take it) and, of course, Amtrak (Google Maps suggested taking the Amtrak bus from Oakland to San Francisco—not worth it).

Saturday marked the final day of the U.S. part of our trip. We took pictures of the Golden Gate Bridge at Battery Spencer (hard to get a parking spot even at this time of the year!), visited Alamo Square with its famous ["Painted ladies"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painted_ladies) and spent the rest of the day in coffee shops in the up-and-coming Mission District.

So after quite exactly three years, it's time to say Good Bye, USA!
