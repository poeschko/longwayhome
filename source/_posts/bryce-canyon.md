Bryce Canyon is one of the highlights in terms of landscapes. It's not so much a canyon as a gallery of large needle-like rock formations, so-called "hoodoos". Add some snow to it and you've got an almost surreal scenery.

You can walk around the rim and hike down into the canyon. We did the Navajo Loop and the Queens Garden trails, and we also drove to the Inspiration Point overlook.

Everything was already closed down for the season at Bryce Canyon Village, so it was a challenge to find the hot chocolate we were craving after our hike in the snowy canyon. Thanks Subway for staying open all year round!
